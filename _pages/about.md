Hey! Here's Enguang. I'm a passionate researcher and computer science enthusiast. I'm working toward my CS PhD degree at [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Statistics & Computer Science with the highest distinction, and then the master degree at UIUC as well.

<!--- My skills span various programming languages including C/C++, Python, Java, Julia, Matlab, R, and Rust. I'm adept in tools like Pandas, NumPy, Sympy, as well as deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. 

My experiences are diverse. From being a Software Engineer Intern at Huawei Inc., where I developed probabilistic programming libraries and tensor-based statistics libraries, to contributing as a Research Assistant at the University of Illinois where I worked on probabilistic programs and their robustness evaluation.

I've also engaged in exciting projects such as designing a ROS-based swarm drones simulation package and enhancing GPS spoofing detection in disadvantaged platforms.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm dedicated to teaching. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I've mentored students in mastering system programming, advanced I/O handling, memory optimization, and more.

I'm driven by a curiosity to bridge theory and real-world implementation. My research statement revolves around robotics perception, system design, networking, and security. My recent work on swarm-based GPS spoofing detection demonstrates my commitment to advancing technology for practical impact across domains.

Looking forward to new challenges and opportunities as I continue on this exciting journey!

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on enabling efficient on-device machine learning for resource-constrained platforms such as Raspberry Pi, smartphones, and NPUs. I am particularly interested in optimizing inference for large language models (LLMs) through techniques like model quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration, ensuring high performance while minimizing power consumption.

Additionally, I explore robotics perception, system design, and security, with a focus on addressing real-world challenges. In my MILCOM 2023 [paper](http://enguang2.github.io/files/milcom2023.pdf), I proposed a novel sensor fusion architecture to counter GPS spoofing in resource-constraint devices. By integrating data from inertial measurement units, neighboring communication, and signal strength analysis, the system enhances GPS integrity and navigation accuracy in GPS-denied environments.
