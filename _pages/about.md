Hi! Here's Enguang. I'm a passionate researcher and computer science enthusiast. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Statistics & Computer Science with the highest distinction at the same school. My educational journey began in Beijing Jiaotong University, where I initially majored in Telecommunication Engineering before transferring to UIUC. My reseach interest span I am actively exploring PhD opportunity starting from Fall 2024, please drop me an email if you think I might be a good fit.

<!--- My skills span various programming languages including C/C++, Python, Java, Julia, Matlab, R, and Rust. I'm adept in tools like Pandas, NumPy, Sympy, as well as deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. -->

My experiences are diverse. From being a Software Engineer Intern at Huawei Inc., where I developed probabilistic programming libraries and tensor-based statistics libraries, to contributing as a Research Assistant at the University of Illinois where I worked on probabilistic programs and their robustness evaluation.

I've also engaged in exciting projects such as designing a ROS-based swarm drones simulation package and enhancing GPS spoofing detection in disadvantaged platforms.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm dedicated to teaching. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I've mentored students in mastering system programming, advanced I/O handling, memory optimization, and more.

I'm driven by a curiosity to bridge theory and real-world implementation. My research statement revolves around robotics perception, system design, networking, and security. My recent work on swarm-based GPS spoofing detection demonstrates my commitment to advancing technology for practical impact across domains.

Looking forward to new challenges and opportunities as I continue on this exciting journey!

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
