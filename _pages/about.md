Hi! Here's Enguang. I'm a passionate researcher and computer science enthusiast. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Statistics & Computer Science with the highest distinction at UIUC as well. My educational journey began in Beijing Jiaotong University, where I initially majored in Telecommunication Engineering before transferring to UIUC. ~~**I am actively exploring Fall 2024 PhD opportunity, please contact me if you think I am a good fit.**~~ **I will be starting my CS PhD at University XXX (please allow me to keep it as a secret for now)**

<!--- My skills span various programming languages including C/C++, Python, Java, Julia, Matlab, R, and Rust. I'm adept in tools like Pandas, NumPy, Sympy, as well as deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. 

My experiences are diverse. From being a Software Engineer Intern at Huawei Inc., where I developed probabilistic programming libraries and tensor-based statistics libraries, to contributing as a Research Assistant at the University of Illinois where I worked on probabilistic programs and their robustness evaluation.

I've also engaged in exciting projects such as designing a ROS-based swarm drones simulation package and enhancing GPS spoofing detection in disadvantaged platforms.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm dedicated to teaching. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I've mentored students in mastering system programming, advanced I/O handling, memory optimization, and more.

I'm driven by a curiosity to bridge theory and real-world implementation. My research statement revolves around robotics perception, system design, networking, and security. My recent work on swarm-based GPS spoofing detection demonstrates my commitment to advancing technology for practical impact across domains.

Looking forward to new challenges and opportunities as I continue on this exciting journey!

Research Interests
======
My research focus centers on robotics perception, system design, networking, and security. In my recent MILCOM 2023 [paper](http://enguang2.github.io/files/milcom2023.pdf) **”Towards Effective Swarm-Based GPS Spoofing Detection in Disadvantaged Platforms”**, I tackled the challenge of countering GPS spoofing for small platforms like Air Launched Effects
(ALEs). By leveraging sensor fusion techniques, including inertial measurement units, communication with
neighboring ALEs, and networking signal strength, I proposed a novel architecture that significantly improves
GPS signal integrity and navigation accuracy in GPS-denied environments. My broader research interests revolve around developing robust solutions that bridge theory and real-world implementation, fostering advancements in technology with tangible impacts across diverse domains.
