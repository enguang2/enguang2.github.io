## Abstract
Modern battlefields are subject to spoofing of
GPS signals. While large aircraft platforms can counter the
effects of GPS spoofing via redundant and dissimilar sensors,
the disadvantaged nodes with smaller platforms such as Air
Launched Effects (ALE), with more limited capabilities, can be
vulnerable. That said, other sensors on the platform may give
clues to the drone about where it is located. In this paper, we
investigate the ability of sensor fusion to remediate spoofing of
GPS signals for ALE platforms. We first conduct performance
comparison among several complementary techniques, including
the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs), communication
with nearby ALEs (to compare GPS readings), received signal
strength from networking connections (to estimate distance to
neighboring ALEs, etc.) We then propose a novel architecture
that performs sensor fusion to intelligently combine observations
across multiple sensors so as to maximize the ability to detect GPS
spoofing as well as to reconstruct coordinates with confidence
levels. From a simulation study based on real-world mobility and
sensor traces, we find that our approach can improve location
estimates accuracy by multiple orders of magnitude as compared
to simple baseline techniques, supplementing the ability for ALEs
to navigate and execute missions in GPS-denied environments.
